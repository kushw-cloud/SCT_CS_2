# Encryption and description using Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption methods, where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. For instance, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.


## Features

- **Text Input:** Type in the text you want to work with.
- **Shift Value:** Specify the number of positions to shift each letter
- **Encryption:** Encrypt your text with the specified shift.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt your text with the specified shift.
- **Preserve Case:** Keeps the original capitalization of letters



## How to use

**1.** Clone this repository to your local machine.

**2.** Run the Python script:
       ```
       python3 text_converter_caesar_cipher.py
       ```

**3.** Choose Action: Decide if you want to encrypt or decrypt.

**4.** Enter Text: Provide the text you want to process.

**5.** Specify Shift: Input how many positions each letter should shift.

**6.** View Result: See the result of your encryption or decryption.
